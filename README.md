# Placenote SDK for Unity
Placenote SDK lets you easily build cloud-based Augmented Reality (AR) apps that pin digital content to locations in the real world. The SDK is compatible with all ARKit enabled phones and can be used to create persistent augmented reality experiences using Unity.
The SDK includes 4 sample scenes that you can use as starting points for your projects.

* Note: Placenote SDK for Unity currently supports only iOS devices (iPhone and iPad). Android support will be coming soon.

* This fork was created to fix building on windows.
